CHDigitInput
============

Alernative iOS Control for UIPickerView for entering Integer Values. The disadvantage of the standard picker view is that for example you want to enter the number 999999 but the control is currently on 555555 it will take some time to scroll to the desired value. An option would be to use an ordinary textfield. But if you want to change just the 3 digits in the middle it is also a paint cause you have to move the cursor, hit delete 3 times and then enter your new digits. Heres where CHDigitInput comes in. You get a configurable number of digits presented. When you tap on a digit a numpad shows up and you can immediately start entering a new digit, no matter if you want to change the first, the last or some digit in the middle. After setting a new value the focus goes to the next digit automatically until you reach the end or you dismiss the keyboard by yourself. So you are way faster than using a picker and way more comfortable than using an ordinary textview.
